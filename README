SimpleOffscreenBrowser is a very plain example of how to use Chromium Embedded
Framework (CEF) to render a web page to offscreen (or in this case, the system
doesn't render it at all!) and then access the underlying HTML code of the page.
The implementation is bare-bones and can be used as a skeleton for creating more
complex programs that need full web page manipulation or rendering capabilities.

The application is linked and tested against CEF 1921.1652 branch, downloaded
from cefbuilds.com. I have tested this on Ubuntu 14.04, the code *should* work
also on Mac OSX and Windows environments with no or very minor modifications.
Some changes to the code will likely need to be made in case you want to use 
newer CEF build. For library dependencies etc, see CEF homepage
https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/. Note that if you plan to run this 
on Linux in pure terminal environment, you also need X Virtual Framebuffer.

There are three command line arguments:

--url  defines the web page url that will be fetched
--out  defines the location of the file where the page HTML will be written to 
       or "stdout" for dumping the HTML to standard output
--time defines the time the program waits for page to be loaded. IsLoaded() and
       other such methods are not optimal since CEF doesn't know when all the JS
       scripts have been finalized, so it's better just to wait for pre-defined
       amount of seconds. The default is 10 seconds, but it can be changed with
       this parameter, the value is given as the number of seconds that the
       system will wait for the page to load

Example:

./SimpleOffscreen --url=http://www.google.com/ --out=stdout --time=5
